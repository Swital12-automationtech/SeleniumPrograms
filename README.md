# Selenium WebDriver Learning & Practice Repository

This repository includes structured Selenium WebDriver programs created during hands-on practice and assignments. It covers a wide range of foundational topics in web automation using Java, Selenium, and TestNG. These programs are designed to build practical understanding of locators, browser interactions, element handling, waits, frameworks, and TestNG features.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Maven
- Page Object Model (in framework examples)
- Data-Driven Testing
- Retry Mechanism & Listeners
- GitHub


## Key Concepts Practiced

- Locators (ID, Name, XPath, CSS, LinkText, PartialLinkText)
